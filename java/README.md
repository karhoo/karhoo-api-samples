The demo sample uses Spring, gradle and Java 11.

To run with previous versions of Java the Http call handling in KarhooApiClient needs to be changed, but the rest of the code should work as is.

Requests and responses do not have all elements but are a skeleton to enable an initial implementation.

To run the demo update the username and password in KarhooDemoApplication and then from the command line:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
